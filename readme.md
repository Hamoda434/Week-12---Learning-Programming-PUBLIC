## Level

In the Learning Units for this week, you will need to do a combination of editing written scripts, visual scripts, and Scene elements. Each Learning Unit will have specific instructions to help 
clarify the task for that Unit.

## Bosses

### Bowser

Go out on your own and learn something new about Unity. You can do any of the following:

* Watch Youtube Videos
* Read the Unity Manual
* Do a module at learn.unity.com
* Peruse the Unity Forums or Stack Overflow
* Anything else you want!

Write a short paragraph about what you learned and how it went. If you built something, include it in your repo. 

### Hornet

Turn your State Machine from Unit 05 into a game of some sort. Try to use a combination of Script Graphs, Sub-Graphs, and State Machines.

BONUS: Combine Visual Scripting with written scripting. Implement Properties and / or access modified methods. 

### Demon of Hatred

Choose a simple game (e.g. Breakout, Snake, etc.) and either code it from scratch or begin to code it from scratch.
