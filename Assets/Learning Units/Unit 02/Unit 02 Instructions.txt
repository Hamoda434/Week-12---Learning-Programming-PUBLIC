Unit 02 Instructions

The goal of this unit is to make it such that when
the Toggle is pressed, the on-screen text displays
either one message or the other. 

You will need to make the same changes to the scene
you made in Unit 01 to get the Toggle to work.

You also need to add a SINGLE WORD to the SetTextValue.cs
script to make it work as intended, then you'll need
to change something in the Scene to finish.
