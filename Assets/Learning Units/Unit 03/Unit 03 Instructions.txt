Unit 03 Instructions

The goal of this Unit is to have the velocity of the Red Cube 
transfer to the Blue Cube when the Red Cube enters the trigger.
ADDITIONALLY: when the Blue Cube reaches a certain velocity, 
the Debug Console will say "True";

No new nodes need to be created, but you need to hook some of them
up properly. (Keep in mind this Unit has a SUB-GRAPH as well-- double
click it to look at the code in there.)

You also need to update something on the Inspector for the TriggerCube,
or else it won't work.
